Latex or images do not seem to load on github's markdown by default, so you have to clone it locally and use some editor/viewer.

## Mac
Use [Macdown (latest testing build)](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/history/testing/).

Enable LaTeX generation:

1. Preferences
2. Rendering
3. Check "Text-like Math symbols" and "use $ as in-line delimiter"

## Windows
I think you can probably use RMarkdown, though I haven't checked myself.
